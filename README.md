# EPIC-CP-Follow-up

This framework was developed to follow-up patients' visits and their EPIC-CP questionnaire records. The patients are required to fill out this questionnaire in different periods since the day their treatment is started (3 months, 6 months, 9 months etc. after). This framework helps hospital staff to keep track of whose EPIC-CP records are missing and whose due is past. For more information about EPIC-CP, please visit https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/tre.504

The project is written in Java, using some Apache API tools. 

I have provided a sample dataset in this project. The data used here is not related to any patients treatment data.
